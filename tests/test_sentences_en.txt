The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God.
All that glitters is not gold.
Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana.
The early bird catches the worm.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
Actions speak louder than words.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
Knowledge is power.
Practice makes perfect.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
Where there's a will, there's a way.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Better late than never.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
You can't have your cake and eat it too.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
A stitch in time saves nine.
The best of both worlds.
Speak of the devil.
Once in a blue moon.
When pigs fly.
To add insult to injury.
A piece of cake.
It's raining cats and dogs.
Kill two birds with one stone.
Break a leg.
Cutting corners.
Hit the nail on the head.
Under the weather.
Call it a day.
On cloud nine.
A blessing in disguise.
Get out of hand.
The last straw.
The best thing since sliced bread.
Go down in flames.
You can say that again.
Speak of the devil.
The whole nine yards.
A perfect storm.
Break the ice.
Cut to the chase.
Hit the books.
In the heat of the moment.
Keep your chin up.
The ball is in your court.
